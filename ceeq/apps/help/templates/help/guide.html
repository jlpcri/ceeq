                            CEEQ stands for Comprehensive End-to-End Quality. It is a framework for assessing risk
                            and quality control processes by quantifying test artifacts. The CEEQ score provides a
                            superior metric to traditional measurements of bug counts or defect density by controlling
                            for issue severity, affected components, resolution of issues, and retesting of fixes.

                        <p>
                            CEEQ scores are based on the performance of a version in JIRA. Before a score can be assigned,
                            a CEEQ project must be set up. Email QEIInnovation@west.com to get an administrator to
                            configure your project. Please include the JIRA instance (jira.west.com or isr.west.com), the
                            JIRA project key, the version name, and a brief description of the project (such as inbound
                            client implementation, outbound client implementation, inbound product, outbound product, or
                            platform).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For CEEQ to work properly, the JIRA project needs to support either CEEQ standard components
                            or the CEEQ indicator field. Your project admin can set this up if necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything else is just record keeping in JIRA. Ensure that components and affected versions
                            are set for every bug, and CEEQ will take care of the rest.
                        </p>

                            Each bug created adds a number of points to the component defect score equal to the point
                            value currently assigned to the ticket’s severity level and a modifier for its resolution
                            status. For current live projects, the severity map is a linear mapping. For resolution
                            status, resolved tickets carry 20% of their original weight, and closed tickets carry 10% of
                            their original weight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The issue weight is aggregated per subcomponent and scaled down by the defect scalar
                            (currently 15) to give us a component CEEQ score. In the future, this will be further
                            modified by a component complexity modifier: this is currently unimplemented and is pending
                            standardized measurements of complexity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project CEEQ score is an average of the component CEEQ scores, weighted by the component
                            impact scores. These component impact weights vary between project types and are tailored to
                            the risk assessments of each.

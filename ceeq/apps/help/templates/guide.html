                                <p>This document is an introduction to the CEEQ - Comprehensive End-to-End Quality evaluation tool.
                                There are some previous web application experience are presumed, such as: web search, web explore etc.</p>
                                <p>This user guide does not cover 100% of the features, however, it will explain all the main concepts
                                 and help you get started. At the meantime, it provides other learning resources for your further reading.
                                This material will help you be ready to begin exploiting our tools.</p>

                                <li><strong>What is CEEQ?</strong></li></p>
                                <p>Comprehensive End-to-End Quality is the novel framework to describe the measurement of
                                IVR Applications based on tracked issues in JIRA system.</p>
                                <p>CEEQ ranges from <strong>0 -10</strong> to illustrate the quality of IVR Apps.
                                    CEEQ helps our testing procedure on assembled
                                IVR Apps become more quick, easy and accurate through software lifecycle.</p>
                                <p>As somebody says: "You cannot control what you cannot measure."
                                    Measurement is the process by which numbers or symbols are assigned
                                    to attributes of entities in the real world in such a way as to describe them
                                    according to clearly defined unambiguous rules</p>
                                <p>The Risk management of our testing procedure indicates that
                                    IVR Apps failure has caused more than inconvenience.
                                    The causes have ranged from poorly designed user interface to
                                    direct programming errors.</p>
                                <p>Also, an IVR application with good structural quality costs
                                    less to maintain and is easier to understand and change in
                                    response to pressing business needs.</p>
                                <p>The CEEQ is expected to be useful in evaluating our internal IVR applications
                                from begin to end.</p>

                                <p>Measurement is the process by which numbers or symbols are assigned to attributes of

                                    <p>The principal concern regarding security is to prevent information from unintended use by unauthorized persons. Security testing attempts to compromise a systemâ€™s security policy by assessing a systemâ€™s vulnerability to threats.</p>
                                <li>Reliability</li></p>
                                    <p>An objective of reliability testing is to monitor a statistical measure of software maturity over time and compare this to a desired reliability goal. </p>
                                <li>Efficiency</li></p>
                                    <p>The efficiency quality attribute is evaluated by conducting tests focused on time and resource behavior. Efficiency testing relating to time behavior is covered below under the aspects of performance, load, stress and scalability testing.</p>
                                <li>Maintainability</li></p>
                                    <p>Maintainability tests in general relate to the ease with which software can be analyzed, changed and tested. Appropriate techniques for maintainability testing include static analysis and checklists.</p>
                                <li>Portability</li></p>
                                    <p>Portability tests in general relate to the ease with which software can be transferred into its intended environment, either initially or from an existing environment. Portability tests include tests for installability, co-existence/compatibility, adaptability and replaceability.</p>

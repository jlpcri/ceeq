            <p>
                CEEQ ranges from <strong>0 -10</strong> to illustrate the quality of IVR Apps.

                easy and accurate through software lifecycle.

            <p>Software Testing Characteristics describe the IVR Applications testing procedure during
            it's software lifecycle. It will affect quality score of project in some degree.</p>

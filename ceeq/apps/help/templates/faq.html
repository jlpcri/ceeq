            <h3>Q: What is the CEEQ?</h3>
            <p>
                CEEQ - Comprehensive End-to-End Quality is the novel framework to describe the measurement of
                West developed solutions based on tracked issues in JIRA system.

            <p>
                You need log in with your West Credential.

            <p>
                CEEQ score ranges from <strong>0 -10</strong> to illustrate the quality of West developed solutions.
                CEEQ score helps our testing procedure on assembled West developed solutions become more quick,
                easy and accurate through software lifecycle.

            <p>Software Testing Characteristics describe the West developed solutions testing procedure during
            it's software lifecycle. It will affect CEEQ score of project in some degree.</p>
